# Multiplayer Hardcore

This is a plugin that will reset worlds for you when anybody on the server dies

## Setup

- Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Hoi15A/multiplayer-hc/releases) from the releases page
- Put the plugin in your plugins folder
- Add this line into your server startup script before the server start: `java -jar plugins/multiplayer-hc-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`

Notes:
- This plugin will override the motd
- World copies (right after death) are stored in `world-backups` by default
